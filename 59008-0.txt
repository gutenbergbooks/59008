. . . she came presently to me with a bowl of broth in her hands and a timid smile on her lips.

. . . with her own hands she drove the nail.... Then she turned.

. . . Ludwig, all his indifference cast to the winds, continued to stamp and scream.

The general waited on her with the utmost attention, riding by her bridle-rein.

We were alone. . . . I whispered in her ear.

Before I could recover myself a pair of strong arms closed round mine and bound them to my sides.

But with all--she controlled herself. She rose stiffly from her seat.

LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS
With a gesture between contempt and impatience the duke removed his hat. Frontispiece.

She looked directly at me.

In an instant I was on the other side of the fence.

Stole down the stairs and into the garden.

My companion seized my wrist.

The constable led me out of the crowd.

"When my back is turned go through that window."

He wore a dingy morning-gown and had laid aside his wig.

"Damn your King William, and you too!" he cried.

He pressed the ring of cold steel.

In the great chair sat an elderly lady leaning on an ebony stick.

I heard a light foot following me.

With a gesture between contempt and impatience the duke removed his hat.

I flung my arms round him from behind, and with my right hand jerked up the pistol.

A slight gentleman ambled and paced in front of a child.

"Now we will have that letter, if you please."

I saw a man had come to a stand before the door.

The place was nothing more than a concealed cupboard.

And turning from me, he began to pace the room, his hands clasped behind him.

She came a step nearer to me, and peered at me.

Sir John ... stared at me a moment.

She listened in silence, standing over me with something of the severity of a judge.

He shut himself in with his trouble.

I stood there at last ... the faces at the table all turned towards me.

She was making marks on the turf with a stick.

They paid off the Guide under the walls of the old Priory Church at Cartmel.

"I give you a last chance," he said.

He neither cared nor saw who it was whom he had jostled.

The face was Stewart's!

... he touched his brow with his whip handle.

Grocott ... stole forward, and ... leant over the flushed features of the unconscious lad.

'This must be--must be stopped at once!'

'Oh, la! I don't want to stay!' Mrs. Martha cried.

'He cannot!'

'About the two guineas--you stole this morning.'

He stood, grinning in his finery, unable to say a word.

Lady Betty wasted no time on words. She was already in the water and wading across.

'Why, Betty,' Sophia cried in astonishment, 'What is it?'

'Do you sit, and I'll make you a posy.'

Her hair ... hung undressed on her neck. He touched it gently. It was the first caress he had ever given her.
